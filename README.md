# 🎥 YouTube Homepage Clone

A simple clone of the YouTube homepage made using `HTML` and `CSS`. I followed a [YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc) by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev) and this was the main project of the course.

I highly recommend the course to beginners who want to learn `HTML` and `CSS`, as I found it very helpful.
